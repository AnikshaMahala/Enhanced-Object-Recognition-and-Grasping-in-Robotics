# Enhanced-Object-Recognition-and-Grasping-in-Robotics
Implemented object detection and grasping systems using SSD for classification, Convex Hull for boundary detection, and Distance Transform for grasping points. Converted CAD models to point cloud data and applied OpenCV for 2D image processing, enhancing precision and efficiency in robotic pick-and-place tasks.
